# Configuration for YOLOv8 RPG View
# smoothing_alpha: EMA alpha (0.0 - 1.0). If set, new measurements are blended
# with previous stored values to reduce jitter. Higher values favor new
# measurements (less smoothing). Set to 1.0 to disable smoothing.
smoothing_alpha: 0.6

# ref_distance: Reference distance in meters used when normalizing pixel
# heights to compute HP. The code computes expected pixel height at this
# distance and scales observed upper-body pixel height relative to it.
ref_distance: 2.0

# hp_scale: Calibration multiplier for HP output. Increase to raise computed
# HP values across the board; useful if bars look too low/large for your
# camera/resolution.
hp_scale: 1.0

# pending_timeout: Seconds a detection must remain visible (continuous)
# before its HP/Mana are committed. While pending, a gray box and
# provisional bars/countdown are shown.
pending_timeout: 2.5

# person_timeout: Seconds after last-seen to forget a person and free their
# slot. Increase to keep persons persisted longer.
person_timeout: 30.0

# min_bbox_height: Minimum bounding-box height in pixels to consider a
# detection valid. Detections with a height smaller than this will be ignored
# (useful to filter out noise and very small / distant detections).
min_bbox_height: 100
